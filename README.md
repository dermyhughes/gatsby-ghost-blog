# Dermot Hughes Blog and Portfolio

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/cbfdd454-5633-4ee5-80df-225622a4f25d/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/dermothughes/deploys)

I decided a needed a new portfolio website and somewhere to post the odd blog. I wasn't interested in WordPress and wanted to use this to learn some new skills.

This is built using [Ghost](https://ghost.org) & [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) so I can learn some React, Node and GraphQL. It uses Ghost as a headless CMS to manage my content, images, posts etc without needing to make code changes. It's hooked via Netlify so when I make a post, it rebuilds and deploys a new version of the static site created by Gastby.
